# travel_book_webapp

#A full fledged web app which can be used to book flights, trains, bus, cabs and hotel. With simple and smooth interface, this application is designed to provide users with best of the features.

#Features like dynamic pricing, rating and reviewing hotels are also provided to the users for complete clarity.

#This app doesn't use any pre-existing api's and contains it's own scripts and api's for generating its entire database and accessing it.

#All the codes and scripts are written from scratch to implement an original online booking platform.

#The Frontend is based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, BootStrap and AngularJS while the backend is built using Java, Hibernate framework and MySql database.

#Restful Api's were created to connect both ends.
